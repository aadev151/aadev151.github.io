        Hi, my name is Alex; I'm a Software Engineering major and a 
        <a onclick="turnSection(7)" href="javascript:;">Noblitt Scholar</a> at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
        I'm an innovative, open-minded, and creative person willing to do meaningful things.
        I'm passionate about lifelong learning and want to become proficient in my field one day.

    <h2>
        <span style="color:red">a</span><span style="color:orange">a</span><span style="color:green">dev</span>
        stands for <span style="color:red">A</span>lex <span style="color:orange">A</span>nisimov is a <span style="color:green">dev</span>eloper
    </h2>
    <p>
        I'm passionate about coding and automating things. It all started with a small program written in PascalABC.
        I've created a simple electronic watch with a couple of lines of code. But that opened up a whole new world of
        possibilities for me. Since then, I got experience in <strong>Object Oriented Programming, Git, virtual environments,
        relational databses</strong>, and a lot more things I couldn't even imagine doing back that day. And I want to learn more.
        I'm passionate about the idea of lifelong learning and curious about where my coding journey will lead me.
    </p>
    <h2>
        151 because An<span style="color:green;font-family:monospace">ISI</span>mov lookes like An<span style="color:green;font-family:monospace">151</span>mov
    </h2>
    <p>
        I love <strong>thinking outside the box</strong> and using creative approach to things. When I solve problems,
        I try to look for things other people don't see or miss. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        All together, <span style="color:orange">aadev151</span> is a truly unique character set, which allows me to represent myself.
        I have never came across a website that had aadev151 taken as a username, and even aadev151.com is available for registration!
    </h2>
    <p>
        I strive to bring things to perfection. In other words, I'm into <strong>optimizing</strong>. I love the feeling when I know
        that every single detail on a website has its own place.
    </p>
    <h2>aadev151.github.io/hostedbyme</h2>
    <p>
        I'm committed to making the world a better place, however hackneyed this may sound. I actively promote my idea of
        "helpful coding" &mdash; that is, using programming for social and environmental good. Along with HostedByAadev151, which is
        a free hosting for those who cannot afford buying a paid plan, I have several projects and project ideas embracing this
        concept. As a bottom line, <strong>I would really love to work on something meaningful</strong>.
